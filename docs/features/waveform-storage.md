# Waveform Storage
The sensor holds an archive of recorded waveforms on the device. This ensures that all recorded data is securely stored on a reliable storage medium on-site.

Depending on the sample rate the sensor and the equipped storage solution, the sensor can hold up to four years of 100 Hz data.

|       | 100 Hz  | 200 Hz   | 400 Hz   |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **8 GB**  | 1 Year  | 6 months | 3 months |
| **16 GB** | 2 years | 1 year   | 6 months |
| **32 GB** | 4 years | 2 years  | 1 year   |

High entropy noise at the station's site can increase the archive's size.
