# Real-time Waveforms
Reliable streaming of real-time and historical waveform data is crucial to a seismic system. QuakeSaver sensors natively provide data access
through different protocols. However, development here is not finished and we will reach out to offer more streaming solutions for our sensors. 

## SeedLink Server
SeedLink is one of the most used streaming solutions for time series data. QuakeSaver sensors provide access in single- and multi-station mode
to stream data to a central infrastructure. Our implementation of SeedLink v3 is compatible with all SeedLink implementation: [slinktool](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/slinktool/), [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org/), [Pyrocko](https://pyrocko.org). Hence, different management software are supported, such as [SeisComp3](https://www.gempa.de/), [SeisGram2k](http://alomax.free.fr/seisgram/SeisGram2K.html).

We focus on **low-latency delivery** of the streamed MiniSeed packages, in optimal conditions the delay is very close to latency of the digital filter path.

## FDSN Web Services
Waveform data be access using the [FDSN Web Services](https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/) protocol. This offers quick access to relevant waveform data through our back-end infrastructure. Quick access to FDSN Web Services is offered by [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org/) and [Pyrocko](https://pyrocko.org) or just your favorite web browser.

## Local Waveform Archive

Additional to real-time waveform access the devices provision disk space for local waveform storage. Here day-files can be stored for physical retrieval from the field.
